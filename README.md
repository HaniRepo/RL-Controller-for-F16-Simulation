# RL-Controller-for-F16-Simulation
We investigate how formal temporal-logic specifications can enhance the safety and robustness of reinforcement-learning control in aerospace applications. Using the open-source AeroBench F-16 benchmark, we train a PPO agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed.
